# [NFT Minter & Viewer](https://nft-minter-viewer-blockchainclubvit-six.vercel.app/)

## Hey there! Welcome to the NFT Minter & Viewer!  
## Hosted on Vercel(Link - https://nft-minter-viewer-blockchainclubvit-six.vercel.app/)

So, what's this all about? Well, it's a cool little app (we call them dApps in the crypto world!) that lets you do two main things:
- **Create your very own NFTs!** Yep, you can mint them right here.  
- **See all the NFTs you own!** No more guessing, your collection is right in front of you.  
We're building this on the **Ethereum blockchain** (specifically, the Sepolia testnet, so no real money involved for now!), and we're using some awesome tools like:  

- **Alchemy** for all the blockchain magic  
- **Pinata** to keep your NFT stuff safe and sound on IPFS  

## What Can This [App](https://nft-minter-viewer-blockchainclubvit-six.vercel.app/)
) Do?

- **Wallet Hook-up**: Connect your MetaMask wallet super easily.  
- **Minting NFTs**: Got an image or a cool idea? Give it a name, a description, and even add some unique traits. Boom, instant NFT!  
- **IPFS Power**: All the info about your NFT gets stored securely on IPFS, thanks to Pinata. Pretty neat, huh?  
- **Your NFT Gallery**: See all your digital treasures! The app fetches your NFTs straight from the blockchain, so it's always up-to-date.  
- **Looks Good Anywhere**: Whether you're on your phone or a big screen, it's designed to look great.  

## Tools We're Using

- **React.js**: That's the main tech for the app's look and feel.  
- **Ethers.js**: Our go-to for talking to the blockchain.  
- **Alchemy**: Helps us grab all your NFT info and chat with the Sepolia testnet.  
- **Pinata**: Our friendly neighborhood IPFS service.  
- **MetaMask**: Your digital wallet, essential for all the blockchain fun.  
- **Create React App & Friends** (react-app-rewired, customize-cra): These help us build everything smoothly, even with some tricky bits like Webpack 5.  
- **Plain Old CSS**: Keeping things looking sharp!  

## Let's Get Started!

Wanna run this on your own computer? Here's how to set it up.

## üìã Stuff You'll Need First

Make sure you've got these installed:

- **Node.js & npm**: [Grab them from here](https://nodejs.org/). It's like the engine for our app.  
- **Git**: [Get it here](https://git-scm.com/). You'll need this to grab the project files.  
- **MetaMask Extension**: [Install it for your browser from here](https://metamask.io/). This is your digital wallet for Ethereum. Once it's in, set it up for the Sepolia Test Network. You'll need some test ETH for gas fees ‚Äì you can usually get some free from a [Sepolia Faucet](https://sepoliafaucet.com/). There are other ways too, like Google Cloud Web3 portal or PoW faucets if you're feeling adventurous!

## üìÇ Getting the Project Files

**Clone the project:**  
Open your terminal (that's the black screen where you type commands) and type this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soumyaGhoshh/nft-minter-viewer-blockchainclubvitb.git
cd nft-minter-viewer-blockchainclubvitb/soumya's-project/nft-minter/
```

**Install everything:**  
Now, inside that project folder, run this command to get all the necessary bits and bobs:
```bash
npm install
```
## üîë Setting Up Your Secret Keys (Environment Variables)

You'll need a special file called `.env` in the main project folder (`nft-minter`). This file holds your secret API keys and contract address, and don't worry, Git won't let it get accidentally uploaded to GitHub.

### Creating the .env File
 Create a new file named `.env` in the `nft-minter` directory
 Copy and paste the following content into it:
```env
REACT_APP_PINATA_KEY="YOUR_PINATA_API_KEY"
REACT_APP_PINATA_SECRET="YOUR_PINATA_SECRET_API_KEY"
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_KEY="YOUR_ALCHEMY_API_KEY"
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_NETWORK="eth-sepolia"
REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="YOUR_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
```

- Pinata Keys: Grab these from your Pinata account dashboard.

- Alchemy API Key: Head over to your Alchemy dashboard and create a new app for Sepolia.

- Alchemy Network: Keep this as eth-sepolia for the Sepolia testnet.

- Contract Address: This is the unique ID for your NFT smart contract on Sepolia.

- Running the App on Your Computer
Once all that's done, you're ready to roll!
```bash
npm start
```

Your app should pop open in your browser at http://localhost:3000. It'll even refresh itself as you make changes ‚Äì pretty neat!
