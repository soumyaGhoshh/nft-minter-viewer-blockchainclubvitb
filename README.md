Created this repo for the blockchain club's recruitment task and it went well. This was mainly a frontend specific task but it required me to do a lot of things related to blockchain for example creating a smart contract, using alchemy api, using pinata as a decentralised file sharing network, also used metamask wallet to viewing the nfts.
